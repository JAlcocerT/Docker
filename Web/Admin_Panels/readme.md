AdminJS is an automatic admin interface that can be plugged into your application.

You, as a developer, provide database models (like posts, comments, stores, products or whatever else your application uses), and AdminJS generates UI which allows you (or other trusted users) to manage content.

Inspired by: django admin, rails admin and active admin.

>  AdminJS is an **admin panel for apps written in node.js**
