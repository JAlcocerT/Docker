```yml
version: '3.9'
services:
  medama:
    image: ghcr.io/medama-io/medama:latest
    container_name: medama
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - LOGGER=pretty
    ports:
      - "8085:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    networks:
      - nginx_nginx_default #for https

networks:
  nginx_nginx_default:
    external: true  
```

> You will need https to access with these: `admin/CHANGE_ME_ON_FIRST_LOGIN`


as per the docs:

Add Your First Website

Success! You can now add your first website to the analytics instance by visiting the web interface at `http://localhost:8080` or the publicly accessible hostname for your deployment.

The **default login credentials** are:

```txt
Username: admin
Password: CHANGE_ME_ON_FIRST_LOGIN
```

To successfully login, you must either use localhost or a HTTPS connection. Logging in via an unencrypted HTTP connection will not work.

For that, you can use NGINX!
