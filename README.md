## Why Docker?

[Docker is a tool](https://fossengineer.com/docker-first-steps-guide-for-data-analytics/) designed to make it easier to **create, deploy, and run applications by using *containers*.**

Containers allow us to **package up an application with all of the parts it needs to work properly** -  such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package.
 
Everything needed to run a software application successfully can be stored in a container to **make development and deployment more efficient**.

## Docker and your favourite Apps

I have been **collecting/adapting the config files** to install with Docker several Apps and consolidated it on this repository for anyone that might find it helpful.
